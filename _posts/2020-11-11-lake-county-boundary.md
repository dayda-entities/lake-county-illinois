Although technically the county's eastern border extends eastward into Lake
Michigan to the state line where Illinois meets Michigan, we routinely use the
Lake Michigan shoreline as our eastern boundary for mapping purposes. The
north, west and south boundaries are based on a compilation of survey data
which aligns well, but not perfectly, with the border as mapped by neighboring
counties and the State of Wisconsin, which forms the northern boundary of the
county.<br /><p>
