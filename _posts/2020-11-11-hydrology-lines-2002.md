<p><b><a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com/lakecountygis-public/water/hydrology_arc.zip' target='_blank'>Download In State Plane Projection Here</a>.Â </b><br /></p><p>This dataset represents the linear water features (for example, dams,
 culverts, and streams) and the outer boundary of the water feature 
areas (for example, lakes and ponds) of Lake County, Illinois. The 
features in the dataset include: dams, culverts, local drainage; and the
 outer boundary of lakes, ponds, detention/retention basins, 
river/streams/creeks greater than five feet wide, and islands.</p>

        <p>The data has not been field verified and errors and/or omissions may be present.</p>

        <p>The names used for the water bodies were collected from a 
number of sources including: existing datasets, historic maps and/or 
atlases, <a href='http://geonames.usgs.gov/'>US Geologic Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)</a>,
 current and historical USGS topographic quadrangle maps, local 
publications on place names within the county, and platted subdivisions.</p>

        <p>The dataset was traced from aerial photography captured 
between April 13 and April 26, 2002. The water features were compiled 
using softcopy analytical stereoplotters. This dataset should meet 
National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1:1200 product and it is 
georeferenced to the Illinois State Plane, Eastern Zone, using the NAD83
 HARN horizontal datum.</p>
