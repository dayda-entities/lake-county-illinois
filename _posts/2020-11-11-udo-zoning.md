The zoning shapefile defines the geographic extent of zoning districts in unincorporated Lake County as established by the Lake County Code Chapter 151: Unified Development Ordinance. The zoning shapefile is used to create the official zoning maps for the County. It is updated, as need, to reflect annexations and disconnections and rezoning.
