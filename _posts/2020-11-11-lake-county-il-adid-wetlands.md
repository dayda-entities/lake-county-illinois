<p><b><a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com/lakecountygis-public/water/adid.zip' target='_blank'>Download In State Plane Projection Here</a>.Â </b><br /></p><p>Boundaries of designated high quality ADID wetlands established as a result of a formal process under the direction of the <a href='http://www.epa.gov/'>U.S. Environmental Protection</a> Agency. Part 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act authorizes the USEPA and the <a href='http://www.usace.army.mil/'>US Army Corps of Engineers</a>
 to identify in advance of specific permit requests aquatic sites which 
will be considered as areas generally unsuitable for disposal of dredged
 or fill material. This process is called an Advanced Identification or 
ADID. Under the ADID process identification of an area as generally 
unsuitable for fill does not prohibit applications for permits to fill 
in these areas. Therefore the ADID designation of unsuitability is 
advisory not regulatory.</p>

        <p>An ADID designation lets a potential applicant know in 
advance that a proposal to fill such a site is not likely to be 
consistent with the 404(b)(1) guidelines, and the USEPA will probably 
request permit denial.</p>

        <p>ADID wetland information is also useful in watershed 
planning, land use planning, public land acquisition programs, natural 
resource studies and other purposes.</p>

        <p>The wetland selection criteria and methodology are documented
 in the publication entitled &quot;Advanced Identification (ADID) Study, Lake
 County, Illinois. Final Report, November 1992&quot; which is included in 
this download.</p>

        <p>Boundaries were delineated by the ADID project team on 
orthophotograph background with an intended usage scale of 1&quot; = 400', a 
scale ratio of 1:4800.</p>
