<div><b><a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com/lakecountygis-public/transportation/trails.zip' target='_blank'>Download In State Plane Projection Here</a>.Â </b><br /></div><div><br /></div>This Trails theme is the result of a collaborative effort by the Lake 
County Division of Transportation, the Lake County Forest Preserve 
District, the municipalities of Gurnee, Highland Park, Lake Forest, 
Libertyville, Lincolnshire, Vernon Hills, and Waukegan among others, and
 the GIS Division of the Lake County Department of Information 
Technology.

Note that the trails in this theme are actually constructed, open, 
in-use trails. This theme does not include any future trail plans or 
trails under new construction. In addition, trail loops not greater than
 around 1000 ft were not included (i.e. to avoid isolated playgrounds).

All the geometry has been verified to match the 2014 aerials as much as 
possible but some areas have been drawn with older aerials when the 2014
 tree cover was too dense. Therefore the spatial reference is now in 
NAD83(NSRS2007) vs HARN to match the 2014 aerials. The intended usage 
scale for this theme is 1&quot; = 100' or a scale ratio of 1:1200. This 
specification derives from the scale of the orthophotography used as a 
reference for the trail line features, for trails not mapped through 
field GPS data gathering.

The bike, horse, snowmobile, and walking usage types were chosen since 
we have the most complete information on them. They are blank when 
information is not available.

The surface types are photo interpreted and have not been field 
verified.<br /><br /><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Update Frequency:</span><br />This dataset is updated on a <span style='font-weight: bold;'>weekly</span> basis.
