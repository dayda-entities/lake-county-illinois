<div><b><a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com/lakecountygis-public/tax_districts/city.zip' target='_blank'>Download In State Plane Projection Here</a>.Â </b><br /></div><div><br /></div>Municipal boundaries are based on annexations, court orders
and other legal documents filed in the office of the Recorder of Deeds. Mapping
is based on the legal descriptions from those documents, which relate to
existing parcel boundaries or to the underlying PLSS. Important attributes
include &quot;Type&quot; which contains an &quot;I&quot; if the polygon
represents an incorporated area, and a &quot;U&quot; if unincorporated. The
municipality name for &quot;I&quot; type polygons is included in the attribute
&quot;NAME1.&quot;<br /><p>
